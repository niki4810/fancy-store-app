# About the application
- This is a simple online store application built using `react` and `freactal`. The app consists
of a header, above the fold container and a related items container.
- The related items container is a nested state container.
- NOTE: I created this app for self learning purpose and there may be
a cleaner way to approch few things. Please check the orignal `freactal` repo
for more solid examples.

# Running the example app
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
- After cloning the repo run `yarn install` to install the dependencies. This is needed only once.
- To start the demo app simply run `npm start`
